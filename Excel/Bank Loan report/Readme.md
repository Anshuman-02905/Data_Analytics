# US Bank Loan Report

## Project Overview

This project involves deriving financial Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) from a dataset of US bank loans. The KPIs are segregated by loan status (Good loan vs Bad loan) and the loan demographics are expanded across different categories. A niche category of loans is also examined in detail.

The project includes the following steps:
1. **Data Analysis using SQL**: SQL queries are used to derive the KPIs and perform other calculations.
2. **Data Visualization using Power BI**: The data is loaded into Power BI using SQL, where KPIs and graphics are created. The insights obtained from Power BI are cross-checked with those from SQL.
3. **Dashboard Creation**: A well-arranged dashboard is created in Power BI to display the findings.
