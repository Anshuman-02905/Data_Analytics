# COVID-19 Cases vs Testing Dashboard

## Project Overview

This project presents a comprehensive dashboard analyzing COVID-19 cases and testing across various dimensions. The dashboard includes visualizations of total deaths by state, COVID-19 cases segregated by age group, a count comparison of confirmed cases, cured cases, and deaths, and state-wise ICMR testing data. Additionally, it covers cases divided by gender, vaccination counts (segregated by first and second dosage), types of vaccines administered, and state-wise testing details.

## Data Sources

The data for this dashboard is sourced from several CSV files:

- `AgeGroup Details.csv`: Contains details of COVID-19 cases segregated by age group.
- `Covid Vaccine statewise.csv`: Includes vaccination counts segregated by first and second dosage, and types of vaccines administered (COVAXIN, COVISHIELD, SPUTNIK V).
- `ICMRTesting Labs.csv`: Provides details of ICMR testing labs by state.
- `Statewise testing.csv`: Contains state-wise testing details.
- `Covid-19 Cases.csv`: Provides comprehensive data on COVID-19 cases including confirmed cases, cured cases, and deaths.

## Dashboard Visualizations

The dashboard includes the following visualizations:

- **Map of Total Deaths by State**: A geographic representation of COVID-19 deaths across different states.
- **COVID-19 Cases by Age Group**: A detailed breakdown of COVID-19 cases segregated by various age groups.
- **Count Comparison of COVID-19 Cases**: A comparison chart showing the counts of confirmed cases, cured cases, and deaths.
- **ICMR Testing by State**: Visualization of the ICMR testing data segmented by state.
- **COVID-19 Cases by Gender**: A breakdown of COVID-19 cases divided by gender.
- **Vaccination Counts**: Segregated data showing counts for first-dosage and second-dosage vaccinations.
- **Vaccination Types Administered**: Distribution of the different types of vaccines administered, including COVAXIN, COVISHIELD, and SPUTNIK V.
- **State-wise Testing Details**: Detailed data on testing conducted in each state.

## Conclusion

This dashboard provides a comprehensive view of COVID-19, focusing on cases, testing, and vaccinations. It allows users to gain insights into the spread and control of the virus across different states and demographics.
