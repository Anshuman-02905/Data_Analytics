### DETAILS
We have analyszed our sales on 5 diffrent aspects:

**1)TIMELINE SALES TREND**

We have 2000 sales data points ranging from January 2018 to October 2019.The sales timeline trend can be caputerd and can fine tuned using filters like Employee, Region, Sub Date Range etc.
Pivot table and Chart analysis is used for the following insight.

**2)Region Wise Sales Trend**

We have the Region details of each datapoints. Using this we can figure out which region provides the most Revenue.
From this we figured out Texas Provies the most revenue 26.23% whereas Arizona provides the least revenue 24.30.%
This helps and gives us information where the management need to focus operations.

**3)Sales By Emplohyee**
We have sales record categorised by employee who has done the sale. 
And we have the time line of sales as well. Combining these two data , Sale done by employee and timeline of sales we can overview the performance of each employe overtime of these 2 years.
We have 7 sales emloyee. It is shown that **DWIGHT SHRUTE is the has the best employee performance over these 2 yars.Overall 2019 has lesser amount of sales compared to  2018.**

**4)Item Share**

We are given Item type sold in each sale. Using this information we can figure out the contribution of each item in the overall Revenue.
we found that that Item 1 has the most Revenue contribution over the two years followed by Item 5,Item 2,Item 4,Item 3.
